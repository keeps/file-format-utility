File Format Utilities
=====================

Library that packs a mix of characterization tools for file format identification, feature-extraction and validation, for generic use within other projects.

This library was taken from the [RODA](https://github.com/keeps/roda) project to allow inclusion in other open-source projects that need file characterization features.
